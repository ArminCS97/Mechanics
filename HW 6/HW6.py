"""
Some points to consider:
    1- In elastic collisions we have both the momentum and energy conservation laws work.
    2- Ignoring the air resistance force we can say that he light balls are falling from the same
    height ==> all three approaching the ground with the same speed v0.
    3- Assuming that the light balls are slightly separated, when the heavy ball hits the floor
